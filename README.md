Title: Snakey Snake

Description:
In this single-player game, the goal is to eat as many “shnacks” as possible to maximize the length of your snake. The player loses when the snake either crashes into one of the edges of the screen or to itself. The end screen shows “game over,” as well as the scoreboard that is shown throughout the game.

How to Play:
To control the snake, use the arrow keys (left, right, up and down) accordingly.

Special Features:
While the snake movement is determined by the head of the snake (class), the head and body are two separate classes that are subclasses of the snake class. The snake slows down after the player has "eaten" 10 "shnacks," making it easier for the player to maneuver a longer snake.


***Each class has its own repository, project.greenfoot is the entire file of game.
