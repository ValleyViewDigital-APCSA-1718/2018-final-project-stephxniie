Game: Snakey Snake

Description: Goal is to get as many "shnacks" as you can/ make snake as long as you can without crashing into sides/ into itself. 

How To: User moves arrow keys to control snake (up/down/left/right).

Special Features: 
> While the snake movement is determined by the head of the snake (class), the head and body are two seperate classes that are subclasses of the snake class.
> The snake slows down after the player has "eaten" 10 "shnacks," making it easier for the player to maneuver a longer snake. 

***Each class has its own repository, project.greenfoot is the entire file of game.
